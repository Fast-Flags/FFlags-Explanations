-  Increasing this value results in more physical data being transmitted (e.g., jumping, walking, etc.), significantly improving synchronization with the server. This can reduce server-side client latency, making player movements appear more precise to other users.  
-  Lowering this value decreases the amount of physical data sent, which can be exploited to create desynchronization. However, this does not offer any real advantage, as poor server-side synchronization can cause issues like enemies hitting you even when you are behind cover. *(Not recommended)*  

- **Default Value:** 15  
## Some players refer to this FFlag as "Fast Dash" in [**The Strongest Battlegrounds**](https://www.roblox.com/games/10449761463/The-Strongest-Battlegrounds), but this is incorrect. This is not a "**faster dash**" or any kind of exploit. Instead, this FFlag enhances synchronization with the server.
