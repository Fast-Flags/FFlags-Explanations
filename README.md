# Hey there This channel for explaining what does fflags do!
# DCD FFLAGS

### What does `FFlagSimEnableDCD16` do and what does it enable?

**DCD** stands for **Decomposition Detection**. It is a feature that helps detect and optimize complex objects, particularly in games, by analyzing their structure and simplifying them for better performance.

---

## How to enable Decomposition Detection (DCD)?

To enable DCD, use the following FFlag:

```json
{
  "FFlagSimEnableDCD16": "true"
}
```

When you enable this flag, it automatically activates the following fflags:
```json
{
  "DFIntSimCSG3DCDMaxNumConvexHulls": "1000",
  "FIntSimCSG3DCDRecomputeStrategy": "1",
  "DFIntSimCSG3DCDRecomputeTotalWaitMiliSec": "10000"
}
```

# MTU FFLAGS

## What is MTU?
- ### MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) is the maximum size of a data packet that can be transmitted over a network without fragmentation.

- ### Simply put, it's the limit on how large a single chunk of data can be when sent over the internet or a local network. If a packet exceeds the MTU, it gets split into smaller pieces, which can slow down transmission.

- ### ðŸ‘‰ Roblox's default MTU size is **1396 bytes**.

## How to find the optimal MTU using a **ping test**?

### Windows:
1. Open the command prompt (**cmd**)
2. Enter the command:
   ```sh
   ping roblox.com -f -l [MTU size]
   ```
3. Start with **1472 bytes** and decrease the value by **10-12 bytes** until you find the largest value that does not cause fragmentation.
4. Once found, **add 28 bytes** to this value to get the **optimal MTU**.

### Example of setting MTU in Roblox:
```json
{
    "DFIntConnectionMTUSize": "MTU_HERE"
}
```

## How to increase MTU beyond 1472 without issues?
To allow higher MTU values without problems, add the following FFlag:
```json
{
    "DFFlagRakNetMtuPing": "True"
}
```

# Dynamic Resolution Scale
## What does dynamic Resolution Scale mean?
> - The Dynamic Resolution feature helps developers maintain their applicationâ€™s frame rate while rendering at an optimal resolution. Dynamic Resolution automatically adjusts the resolution during heavy GPU work and increases image quality when possible.
### How to enable dynamic Resolution Scale in roblox?
```json
{
    "FFlagRenderDynamicResolutionScale11": "true"
}
```
> - ## Default value (false)
