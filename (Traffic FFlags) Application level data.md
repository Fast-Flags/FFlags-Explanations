**Roblox’s network debug overlay (Shift+F3)** breaks down outgoing traffic by category.  
- **“Out Data”** represents application-level data (e.g. RemoteEvent traffic).  
- **“Out Physics”** is replication (automatic object/physics updates).  

The engine can **throttle each stream** if it exceeds the budget. *(In this example, usage is low, so throttle is 0%.)*  

The **DFIntBandwidthManagerApplicationDefaultBps (64000)** flag sets the baseline for such throttling logic, ensuring one category (like game remotes) doesn’t starve out core replication.  

### **DFIntBandwidthManagerDataSenderMaxWorkCatchupMs (20)**  
- **What it controls:** This setting determines the **maximum “catch-up” interval (in milliseconds)** that the network data sender is allowed to process in one go if it falls behind.  
- In simpler terms, if the **Roblox networking task** (which sends updates to clients) gets delayed or lags, **DataSenderMaxWorkCatchupMs caps how much backlog** it will try to send when it resumes.  
- It’s essentially a **throttle on how much past-due network work can be done in one frame or cycle.**

{
    "DFIntBandwidthManagerApplicationDefaultBps": "64000",
    "DFIntBandwidthManagerDataSenderMaxWorkCatchupMs": "20"
}

### This helps smooth network output and prevents severe spikes. Without this limit, a significant pause could lead to a sudden surge of packets as the server tries to "catch up," potentially overwhelming bandwidth or causing noticeable lag spikes for players.
A lower value generally provides better responsiveness but results in less stable catch-up times, whereas a higher value ensures more stable catch-up but may introduce ping spikes.
## For maximum stability, a higher setting is recommended.
